Daily Hero Story Generator

### Purpose
This application was created in order to generate daily a hero, a villain, an initial story setting and an story objective for role-play in order to bring confidence and decrease anxiety in children.

It was designed with light autism disorder in mind, however, with its great customization, I truly believe this application can also apply to any anxiety situation where the user has a vivid imagination and need to have a goal during his day to go through and cope with difficulties.

Please bear in mind that I am not a medical practitioner, however, being closely acquainted with a child with light autism as well as an adult coping with anxiety, I can tell you that this application has brought us a lot of success. Hence, I decided to share it as an another tool to deal with anxiety!

My initial goal was to have an application where the user selects a hero and villain pair in the morning, and a city, story beginning and story trigger were pulled out randomly to create a daily story to bring about to the day. See our wiki page for more details on how to use the application.

There is a very simple example to use, but the force of the application relies in it's customization, where we encourage creativity. Should you need a more complete version with more story beginnings and triggers, [write to me](mailto:devdessca@gmail.com) and I can provide you with more examples.

Enjoy our Daily Story Generator!
