Daily Hero Story Generator

### Purpose
This application was created in order to generate daily a hero, a villain, an initial setting and an objective in order to bring confidence and decrease anxiety in children. It was designed with light autism disorder in mind, however, with the great customizability of this, I trule believe this application can also apply to any anxiety situation where the user has a lot of imagination and need to have a goal during his day to go through and cope with difficulties.

Please bear in mind that I have no medical background of any kind, therefore I cannot vouch for the actualy benefits of this on a medical perspective. However, being closely acquainted with a child with light autism and having used this to some success, this application is more of personal perspective on the subject in order to bring out another tool to use!

I share this in the hopes that it can help others as much as it has helped us.

See our wiki page for more details on how to use the application.

Enjoy our Daily Story Generator!
